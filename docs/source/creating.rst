3. To use another audio file (rather than the one that comes with your video), check the box titled "**Use a different audio stream.**" A pop-up window will appear from where you can select your alternate audio file. Otherwise, leave the box unchecked.
4. To confirm your selection, click **OK**. The move will now appear in the Jubler interface.

   By default, the audio track is also displayed with the video preview. Jubler needs to be in full screen for the video and audio track to be 
   displayed side-by-side.
